Question:
{question}

Instructions:
1. Each piece of text in the context has an associated ID.
2. Identify any mention of a number (including explicit digits and any reference to “thousand,” “million,” or “billion”).
3. For each found number:
   - Convert it into its fully expanded numeric form (e.g., "3 thousand" → 3000, "15 million" → 15000000).
   - Also preserve the exact original format (the way it appears in the context).
4. If at least one number is found, return them all in a comma-separated list. Use this format for each entry:
   <OriginalNumber> => <ExpandedNumber> (ID: <ID>)
   - For example: 3 thousand => 3000 (ID: 1234), 15 million => 15000000 (ID: 5678)
5. If no relevant number or ID is found, return N/A.
6. Provide no additional text, disclaimers, or explanations beyond your final answer.
